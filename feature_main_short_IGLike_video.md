That’s a fantastic idea — you're essentially creating your own **YouTube Shorts / Netflix-style horizontal trailer strip** for personal video content. Here's how we can organize and implement this smartly.

---

### ✅ Component Name:

**`LiveStreamVideoComponent.vue`**

---

### 🧠 Purpose:

Display a top-strip of **dynamic, real-life, or commentary videos** (not strictly technical showcases), using hover-play and elegant UX like YouTube homepage teasers.

---

### 🧩 Component Layout (3-block strip)

#### Structure (like your image):

```
+----------------------------------------------+
| [thumbnail 1] [thumbnail 2] [thumbnail 3]     |
|  title         title         title           |
|  channel       channel       channel         |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

Each video card:

* Autoplays muted 0–5s on hover.
* Has thumbnail (video poster or auto-preview).
* Title & subtitle (e.g., views / date).
* Click opens full screen route `johnny-alin-data.com/live/:video_id`.

---

### 🎥 JSON Structure for Video Item:

```json
{
  "id": "video123",
  "title": "Taiwan Street Food Tour",
  "subtitle": "3M views • 2 years ago",
  "videoUrl": "https://johnny-alin-data.com/videos/video123.mp4",
  "coverImage": "https://johnny-alin-data.com/thumbs/video123.jpg"
}
```

---

### 💡 Suggested Logic:

* `onMounted()`: fetch 3–5 latest `live_video_items` from `/api/get_live_videos`
* On hover: autoplay muted `.mp4` for 5s (like YouTube-style preview)
* On click: `router.push('/live/' + video.id)` and load full viewer

---

### 📍Where to place it?

Put this **between "Bonjour" and "Certificate"**:

* `Bonjour` → Live video strip → `Guten Tag!` text or `Certificate` section
* Acts as the **first visual hook** after intro
