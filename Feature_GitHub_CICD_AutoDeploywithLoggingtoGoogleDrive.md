# ✅ [Feature] GitHub CI/CD for Auto Deploy with Logging to Google Drive

## 📅 Date
2025-04-30

---

## 🧩 Description
Successfully implemented full CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions to deploy the Vue frontend to EC2 and log deployment events to Google Drive.

---

## 🔨 Features Delivered

- ✅ **Auto deploy on `main` branch push**
  - Configured via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - Triggers `git fetch`, hard reset to `origin/main`, then `npm run build`

- ✅ **Secure EC2 access using SSH key**
  - GitHub Secret: `JA_WEB_01_SSH_KEY`  
  - Key tied to EC2 instance: `35.181.22.152`

- ✅ **Custom build & post-deploy**
  - Runs: `npm run build`  
  - Also triggers:
    - `inject_custom_content.js`
    - `ja_deploy_favicon_20240701.sh`
    - `nginx` reload

- ✅ **Deployment Logging**
  - Log status POSTed to Flask backend via:
    - `/upload_log` (page access)
    - `/upload_deploy_log` (CI deploy)
  - Stored in Google Drive: `web_log/ja_web_01_log__githubDeploy_<timestamp>.json`

- ✅ **GitHub Action Logging**
  - View detailed logs in GitHub repo → **Actions** tab

---

## 🧘‍♂️ Result

> ✅ No more manual EC2 login required for deploying Vue changes.  
> ✅ Just update code and `git push origin main` — and the domain reflects new content.  
> ✅ Deployment status is logged both to GitHub and your Google Drive.
